Crop recommendation and yield prediction are crucial factors in ensuring the profitability and sustainability of agriculture. In this project, we propose a machine learning-based approach that utilizes factors such as soil quality, climate, and other environmental conditions to provide accurate crop recommendations. Furthermore, we use regression analysis to predict the yield of the recommended crops for the upcoming season. Our approach utilizes random forest algorithm for crop recommendation and  and random forest algorithm with rbf kernel for regression analysis
